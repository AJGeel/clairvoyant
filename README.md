## Introduction

Eindhoven Museum (EM) organizes Museum in de Stad (MidS) exhibitions every year based on certain themes. They aim to collect data to learn about their visitors. Installations that were exhibited in the past have successfully generated substantial amounts of data. However, the valorisation of the data has not yet been fully explored. We see opportunities in this area. 

### ðŸ¤– Ray â€” A Conversational User Interface that knows all about you.

The data generated during EM exhibitions is collected in a novel installation, entitled Ray. This installation analyses the data in real-time, and generates rich insights about its visitors, the MidS exhibitions and EM as a whole. The concept is guided by the following vision:

```"What can be learnt whilst still surprising people?"```

As a way to introduce surprise, and educate the public on the emerging influence that data has in our lives, Ray also shares his insights with visitors of EM exhibitions. Ray is featured in the conversational user interface (CUI), to be displayed at one of EM's MidS exhibitions.
